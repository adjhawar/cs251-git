	\section{PLOT}
Kanji Lalji Mehta (Paresh Rawal), a middle-class atheist Hindu owns a shop of Hindu idols and antiques in Mumbai. He is cursed by Siddheshwar Maharaj when he stopped his son from playing dahi handi. A low-intensity earthquake hits the city, and Kanji's shop is the only shop that is destroyed.	
	
	\section{Music }
The songs are few in number and are in just the right places. they take the story forward without adding to unneccesary drama. 'Mere Nishaan', sung by Kailash Kher and Meet Brothers-Anjjan is worth listening to. Shreya Ghoshal and Mika have sung 'Go Go Govinda' to perfection. Sonakshi and Prabhu Deva look good as they dance to its tune.
