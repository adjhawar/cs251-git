Next day at the insurance office, Kanji and his neighbour-assistant Mahadev learn that the disaster claim does not cover any damage caused by natural calamities classified under "Act of God".

	Finally, he meets Hanif Qureshi (Om Puri) and his daughter (Puja Gupta), a poor Muslim lawyer family.Qureshi, a disabled man, helps him file the case as Kanji decides to fight on his own. Legal notices are sent to the insurance company as well as to religious priests, Siddheshwar Maharaj (Govind Namdeo), Gopi Maiyya (Poonam Jhawar) and their group's founder, Leeladhar Swamy (Mithun Chakraborty) summoning them to the court as representatives of God on earth.

\subsection{Music }
The sgs are few in number and are in just the right places. they take the story forward without adding to unneccesary drama. 'Mere Nishaan', sung by Kailash Kher and Meet Brothers-Anjjan is worth listening to. Shreya Ghoshal and Mika have sung 'Go Go Govinda' to perfection. Sonakshi and Prabhu Deva look good as they dance to its tune.

	  \subsection{Plot}
	  'Lagaan' which literally means Tax is a story of ordinary people set in a small village 'Champaner' in Central India during the British rule in 1893. The tale narrates the determination of the villagers to fight against injustice and opposition.
Bhuvan (Aamir Khan) a young farmer takes up the impossible task to save his village. He forms a team of 11 with his fellowmen. Elizabeth (Rachel Shelly), Captain Russell's sister who has a soft corner for Bhuvan gives her full support to the villagers cause despite her brother's opposition. Gauri (Gracy Singh), a village girl loves Bhuvan and has complete faith in him.
\\
The music in this film composed by A.R.Rehman is radically different from other films, it transports us back to the days of the British Raj and gives a right feel of the time. The lyricist and singers have also contributed to the earthy feel and rural touch of the music. Aamir Khan as Bhuvan gives a convincing performance as well. Gracy Singh, has merged with the character of Gauri as a lively and charming village belle. British actors : Paul Blackthorne (Russel) and Rachel Shelley (Elizabeth) both stage artists from Britain and other Indian actors Yashpal Sharma, Raghubir Yadav, Rajesh Vivek, Aditya Lakhia, Amin Hajee have all put in their best.
\\
'Lagaan' shot in and around the Kutch of Bhuj in Gujarat (where the disastrous earth quake took place in 2001) is Aamir Khan's first production. It is commendable that he has made extensive research, even filmed period pieces in the U.K to give a feel of authenticity to the film. Around 40 British actors have played the role of Englishmen and officers.
\\
The cricket sequences have also been taken very well and Ashutosh Gowariker gives a very emotional end to the movie. In contrast to many bollywood movies this is worth a watch, even though it lasts for about 3 hours and 40 minutes.
